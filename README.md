## Description

This course examines how microorganisms have shaped the world around us throughout Earth’s history and what role they play on our planet today. Emphasis is placed on the many ways microbes can make a living (diversity of metabolisms and habitats), how microorganisms drive key biogeochemical processes, and how the planet and microbial biosphere have co-evolved. The course uses team-based-learning (TBL) approaches and is open to both undergraduate and graduate students.

## Structure

The course will consist of 6 modules. Each module has topic-specific learning goals, assignments and team exercises.

1. Communication and Collaboration in Team-based learning
2. Microbial properties & diversity
3. Microbial metabolism & energetics
4. Microbial roles in biogeochemical cycles
5. Microbe-mineral interactions
6. Geomicrobiotechnology


## Schedule

The course schedule including all modules, readings and assignments is available at [2017-Geomicrobiology.github.io/schedule](https://2017-Geomicrobiology.github.io/schedule). Note that the exact schedule for the modules may change as we go along. Check the above link for updates and new information throughout the semester.

## Materials

#### Readings

The readings for this course will include select chapters from the books listed below, PDFs provided through Google Drive, and online resources provided by link. Details on all readings are provided on the [schedule page](https://2017-Geomicrobiology.github.io/schedule). Please note that the University has e-book access to both books but that simultaneous access may be limited to a finite number of users. Please coordinate with your teammates should simultaneous-use restrictions become a problem.

- **Introduction to Geomicrobiology ([CU Boulder ebook](http://search.ebscohost.com.colorado.idm.oclc.org/login.aspx?direct=true&db=nlebk&AN=274665&site=ehost-live&scope=site))**
- **Ehrlich's Geomicrobiology ([CU Boulder ebook](...))**

#### Computer Resources

At least one member per team must bring a laptop to class in case of in-class exercises that require access to online resources. Some team assignments and most individual assignments require access to a computer with internet connection outside of class. If you do not have a personal computer, you are encouraged to make use of the computer lab in the Department of Geological Sciences. The computer lab is open M-F from 6:30am to 6pm and available to you unless it is in active use by a computing class. Should you require after-hour access to the computer lab, please send me an email and include the last 7 digits of your BuffOne card number.

## Evaluation

The overall course grades will be determined by the following components. There will be no midterm or final for this course.

|Type       | Weight | Activity
|-----------|-------:|---------------------------------------------
|Individual |    20% | Individual Readiness Assessment Tests (iRAT)
|Individual |    30% | Term Project
|Individual |    10% | Attendance, Participation and Homework Assignments
|Team       |    20% | Team Readiness Assessment Tests (tRAT)
|Team       |    10% | Team Assignments
|Peer       |    10% | Team Peer Evaluations

### Team Performance
You will collaborate with your team throughout the semester. Team tests and assignments will determine the team performance component of your grade.

##### tRAT scoring

Correct answer on | Points
:----------------:|:-----:
   1st choice     |   5
   2nd choice     |   3
   3rd choice     |   2
   4th choice     |   1
   5th choice     |   0

### Individual Performance

Individual tests, the term project as well as attendance, participation and smaller individual assignments including feedback on writing from team members will determine the individual performance grade.

#### Term Project
For the individual term projects, every student will choose a geomicrobiology topic of interest and prepare a term paper (50%) based on a review of the primary scientific literature, as well as two short "Latest & Greatest" (L&G) perspective pieces (25% each) on individual publications related to the chosen topic (either on a recently published study or a classic paper). The L&Gs are an opportunity to practice and hone your critical reading and writing skills in the context of learning about your topic before writing the actual term paper. Both the L&Gs and the term paper will go through a draft-feedback-revision-submission process that includes feedback from a team member. You can choose one of the following example topics or an approved topic of your own choosing: 1) The role of microbes in acid mine drainage; 2) Microbial mineral processing; 3) Bioremediation; 4) Microbial controls on mineral deposit signatures; 5) Microbes, oil, and gas; 6) Microbial Geoengineering; 7) Terraforming. All members of a team must have a different term project topic.

Students are expected to bounce ideas on potential topics and journal articles for L&Gs off of their teammates. Graduate students are likely to have more experience browsing the scientific literature and are encouraged to help their teammates with the selection of suitable journal articles for their L&Gs.

### Peer Evaluations

You will provide qualitative and quantitative feedback for each of your teammates three times during the semester, which will determine the peer evaluation grades.

### Late Work Policy

Students and teams are responsible for handing in work on time. Work that is turned in one day late will be marked down by 25%.  Work turned in thereafter (and until the final day of class) will be marked down by 50%. No late work will be accepted after the final day of class.

## Tips for success

The ultimate success of this course depends on your participation. You will maximize both your enjoyment of this class and your grade by using the following strategies:
 - Attend all classes.
 - Read all of the [reading materials](https://2017-Geomicrobiology.github.io/schedule#readings) and take notes during your readings.
 - Participate in your team’s discussions, and allow for all team members to also be included in the discussions.

There will be many readings assigned throughout the semester. If you are unfamiliar with reading primary literature, look at these [tips on reading scientific papers](http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/03/how-seriously-read-scientific-paper).

## Academic Climate

It is expected that everyone be respectful to their fellow classmates and instructors. This includes interactions in class, during team work outside of class, and for postings online. In an effort to create a positive atmosphere for learning and teamwork within the classroom, it is requested that you do not use your cell phone during class; limit use of your laptop computer to class purposes; and provide at least 24 hours of advance notice to your team and professor if you will be late or absent from class.

## Academic Integrity

You are expected to abide by the [CU Boulder honor code](http://honorcode.colorado.edu). Submit your own work for all individual assignments and your team's work for team assignments. You are encouraged to consult with your teammates for thoughts and feedback on your term paper topic and the primary literature picks for your latest & greatest reviews, but the writing itself must be your own work. You may incorporate suggestions you receive from teammates through the official written peer feedback verbatum. When researching your topic, consult the primary literature and include appropriate source attribution in the materials you submit.

## Special Accommodation

If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please let your instructor know as soon as possible so that your needs can be addressed. The University [Disability Services](http://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservice/) determines accommodations based on documented disabilities. Contact Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or by email at [dsinfo@colorado.edu](mailto:dsinfo@colorado.edu). If you have a temporary medical condition or injury, see Temporary Injuries guidelines under the Quick Links at the [Disability Services](http://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservice/) website and discuss your needs with your instructor.
