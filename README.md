## What is this course about?

This course examines how microorganisms have shaped the world around us throughout Earth’s history and what role they play on our planet today. Emphasis is placed on the many ways microbes can make a living (diversity of metabolisms and habitats), how microorganisms drive key biogeochemical processes, and how we know about microbial activity in the past and present.

## How is it different?

I teach this course using active classroom and team-based-learning (TBL) methods that I hope will foster an interest in the wonderful world of geomicrobiology, but perhaps even more importantly, will prepare you to solve complex problems and make informed decisions in other life endeavors well beyond this class. It is my goal that by the end of the course, you will have honed your critical thinking and team problem solving skills; improved your ability to read, synthesize, and critically evaluate geomicrobiology literature; and gained a broad understanding of the role of microbes on our planet.

The course will consist of 6 modules. Each module has topic-specific learning goals, assignments and team exercises.

1. Communication and Collaboration in Team-based learning
2. Microbial properties & diversity
3. Microbial metabolism & energetics
4. Microbial roles in biogeochemical cycles and how we know about them
5. Microbe-mineral interactions
6. Final topic selected by the class

## Schedule

The course schedule including all modules, readings and assignments is available at [2017-Geomicrobiology.github.io/schedule](https://2017-Geomicrobiology.github.io/schedule). Note that the exact schedule for the modules may change as we go along. Check the above link for updates and new information throughout the semester.

## Materials

#### Readings

Geomicrobiology is a broad, fast-evolving field that is best understood by engaging with the primary literature. Therefore, in class exercises will often be based on discussions of journal articles within and between the teams, with preparative background readings at the beginning of each module. The readings will include select chapters from the books listed below, PDFs provided through Google Drive, and online resources provided by link. Details on all readings are provided on the [schedule page](https://2017-Geomicrobiology.github.io/schedule/#readings). Please note that the University has e-book access to both books (you may have to create a login with the publisher) but that simultaneous access may be limited to a finite number of users. Please coordinate with your teammates should simultaneous-use restrictions become a problem.

- **Introduction to Geomicrobiology** by Kurt Konhauser, 2007 ([CU Boulder ebook](http://search.ebscohost.com.colorado.idm.oclc.org/login.aspx?direct=true&db=nlebk&AN=274665&site=ehost-live&scope=site))
- **Ehrlich's Geomicrobiology** by Henry Lutz Ehrlich, Dianne Newman and Andreas Kappler (editors), 2016, 6th edition ([CU Boulder ebook](http://search.ebscohost.com.colorado.idm.oclc.org/login.aspx?direct=true&db=nlebk&AN=1070168&site=ehost-live&scope=site))

#### Computer Resources

At least one member per team must bring a laptop to class in case of in-class exercises that require access to online resources. Some team assignments and most individual assignments require access to a computer with internet connection outside of class. If you do not have a personal computer, you are encouraged to make use of the computer lab in the Department of Geological Sciences. The computer lab is open M-F from 6:30am to 6pm and available to you unless it is in active use by a computing class. Should you require after-hour access to the computer lab, please send me an email and include the last 7 digits of your BuffOne card number.

## Evaluation

The overall course grades will be determined by the following components. There will be no midterms and no final for this course. I will provide information on each assignment as we get to it during the semester including detailed instructions on how to complete it.

| Type         |      Weight | Activity                                           |
|--------------|------------:|----------------------------------------------------|
| Individual   |         20% | Individual Readiness Assessment Tests (iRAT)       |
| Individual   |         30% | Term Project                                       |
| Individual   |         10% | Attendance, Participation and Homework Assignments |
| _Individual_ | _Bonus: 5%_ | _Geomicrobiology-related wikipedia article_        |
| Team         |         20% | Team Readiness Assessment Tests (tRAT)             |
| Team         |         10% | Team Assignments                                   |
| Peer         |         10% | Team Peer Evaluations                              |

### Team Performance
You will collaborate with your team throughout the semester. Team tests and assignments will determine the team performance component of your grade.

##### tRAT scoring

| Correct answer on | Points |
|:-----------------:|:------:|
|    1st choice     |   4    |
|    2nd choice     |   2    |
|    3rd choice     |   1    |
|  4th/5th choice   |   0    |

### Individual Performance

Individual preparedness tests (iRATs), the term project as well as attendance, participation and individual assignments including feedback on writing from team members will determine the individual performance grade.

#### Term Project
For the individual term projects, every student will choose a geomicrobiology topic of their interest and complete two written assignments related to the topic.

The first will be a short "Latest & Greatest" (L&G) perspective piece (30% of the term project grade) on a publication related to the chosen topic (either on a recently published study or a classic paper). The L&Gs are an opportunity to practice and hone your critical reading and writing skills in the context of learning more about your topic of interest. 

The second (70% of the term project grade) will be a term paper on your topic based on a review of the primary scientific literature for students taking the undergraduate version of this course; and a short proposal based on a research question related to your topic for students taking the graduate version of this course. Both the L&G and the term paper/proposal will go through a draft-feedback-revision-submission process that includes feedback from one or multiple members of your team.

Students are expected to bounce ideas on potential topics and journal articles for L&Gs off of their teammates. Graduate students are likely to have more experience browsing the scientific literature and are encouraged to help their teammates with the selection of suitable journal articles for their L&Gs.

#### Bonus wikipedia article

If you choose to do this bonus assignment, you will write and publish a geomicrobiology-related Wikipedia article. The topic must still be absent or incomplete (i.e. a "stub") on Wikipedia and may be related to your term project  (but does not have to be). In place of a Wikipedia article, you may suggest creating another shareable resource.

### Peer Evaluations

You will provide qualitative and quantitative feedback for each of your teammates three times during the semester, which will determine the peer evaluation grades.

### Late Work Policy

Students and teams are responsible for handing in work on time. Work that is turned in one day late (i.e. within 24 hours after the deadline) will be marked down by 25%. Work turned in up to a week late will be marked down by 50% but you must let me know when to expect your work or I will reserve the right to deduct points. If you are having trouble with an assignment, please talk with me ahead of time. No late work will be accepted more than a week after an assignment deadline or after the last day of classes.

## Tips for success

The ultimate success of this course depends on your participation. You will maximize both your enjoyment of this class and your grade by using the following strategies:
 - Attend all classes.
 - Read all of the [reading materials](https://2017-Geomicrobiology.github.io/schedule#readings) and take notes during your readings.
 - Participate in your team’s discussions, and allow for all team members to also be included in the discussions.

There will be many readings assigned throughout the semester. If you are unfamiliar with reading primary literature, look at these [tips on reading scientific papers](http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/03/how-seriously-read-scientific-paper).

## Academic Climate

It is expected that everyone be respectful to their fellow classmates and professor. This includes interactions in class, during team work outside of class, and for postings online. In an effort to create a positive atmosphere for learning and teamwork within the classroom, it is requested that you do not use your cell phone during class; limit use of your laptop computer to class purposes; and provide at least 24 hours of advance notice to your team and professor if you will be late or absent from class.

## Academic Integrity

You are expected to abide by the [CU Boulder honor code](http://honorcode.colorado.edu). Submit your own work for all individual assignments and your team's work for team assignments. You are encouraged to consult with your teammates for thoughts and feedback on your term paper topic and the primary literature picks for your latest & greatest reviews, but the writing itself must be your own work. You may incorporate suggestions you receive from teammates through the official written peer feedback verbatum. When researching your topic, consult the primary literature and include appropriate source attribution in the materials you submit.

## Special Accommodations

If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please let your professor know as soon as possible so that your needs can be addressed. The University [Disability Services](http://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/) determines accommodations based on documented disabilities. Contact Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or by email at [dsinfo@colorado.edu](mailto:dsinfo@colorado.edu). If you have a temporary medical condition or injury, see Temporary Injuries guidelines under the Quick Links at the [Disability Services](http://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/) website and discuss your needs with your professor. Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty make every effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who, because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments or required attendance. You must inform your professor [by email](mailto:sebastian.kopf@colorado.edu) as early as possible in the semester (at least 1 week before any scheduled exams or assignments) about any religious observance conflicts.
