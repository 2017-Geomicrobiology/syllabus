## Schedule

The course schedule including all modules, readings and assignments is available at https://2017-Geomicrobiology.github.io/schedule.

## Course Materials

Introduction to Geomicrobiology ([CU Boulder ebook](http://search.ebscohost.com.colorado.idm.oclc.org/login.aspx?direct=true&db=nlebk&AN=274665&site=ehost-live&scope=site))



##  Modules

Module 1: basics of geomicrobiology - diversity of phylogeny and diversity of metabolism

## Computer access

Some team assignments and most individual assignments in this class require access to a computer with internet connection. If you do not have a personal computer, you are encouraged to make use of the computer lab in the Department of Geological Sciences. The computer lab is open M-F from 6:30am to 6pm and available to you unless it is in active use by a computer class. Should you require after-hour access to the computer lab, please send me an email and include the last 7 digits of your BuffOne card number.


#### Writing



### Term paper:
You can choose one of the following topics (or an approved topic of your own choosing) and prepare a term paper based on a review of primary scientific literature. Term papers will be due 2 weeks before the end of classes: 1) The role of microbes in acid mine drainage; 2) Microbial mineral processing; 3) Bioremediation; 4) Microbial controls on mineral deposit signatures; 5) Microbes, oil, and gas; 6) Microbial Geoengineering; 7) Terraforming


#### Late Work Policy

Students are responsible for handing in work on time.  Worked turned in one day late will be marked down by 25%.  Work turned in thereafter (and until the final day of class) will be marked down by 50%.  No late work will be accepted after the final day of class.


#### Writing (News & Views):

News & Views

This is an opportunity to practice and hone your critical reading and writing skills in the context of learning about geobiology.  Every two weeks you will write a short perspective piece on a recently published study broadly related to the geobiology subdiscipline.  The goal is to emulate the style, feeling, and intent of a Nature "News & Views" article.  These articles are limited to 1000 words (excluding figure caption and references).  They should have more than 5 but less than 12 references, and one original color figure that helps explain the interesting aspects of the study being discussed (e.g. - problem, data, methods, results, interpretation).  Make it visually appealing.  Choose a paper that (a) was published in the past month, (b) is on a topic of interest to you and broadly related to geobiology, and (c) makes a breakthrough, however small, in understanding an important geobiological process or event.  You will need to read through a number of papers to find one that is suitable.  Attached in the appendix is a list of some common journals for geobiology research.  Try browsing the most recent issues or articles in press.  And just because a paper already has a published perspective piece (either in Nature or Science Magazine) you can still use it for your N&V, particularly if you disagree with the perspective or see the importance of the study differently.  Your N&V are due at the beginning of class on the due date.  Please compile your articles into pdf format and embed your figure and caption in the text, and submit them electronically via email to Jeff and I.  At the beginning of class on the day N&Vs are due, you will be expected to give a very brief (3 minute) review of your paper to the class.  N&V due dates: Oct. 6, Oct. 20, Nov. 3, Nov. 18, Dec. 1.

Some questions you can ask to get started: What problem is this paper addressing, and why is it important?  What approach did the authors bring to bear on this problem (e.g., new methods, inverse modeling, statistical reanalysis, new observations, new theory)?  Can you reconstruct the logic of the argument?  How were the data interpreted?  How could the data be interpreted?  What did the study do right?  What did it do wrong?  What is the next step?

## Statements on Plagiarism

### SCPS

> New York University takes plagiarism very seriously and regards it as a form of fraud.  The definition of plagiarism that has been adopted by the School of Continuing and Professional Studies is as follows: "Plagiarism is presenting someone else's work as though it were one's own.  More specifically, plagiarism is to present as one's own words quoted without quotation marks from another writer; a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work; or facts or ideas gathered, organized, and reported by someone else, orally and/or in writing.  Since plagiarism is a matter of fact, not of the student's intention, it is crucial that acknowledgement of the sources be accurate and complete.  Even where there is not a conscious intention to deceive, the failure to make appropriate acknowledgement constitutes plagiarism.  Penalties for plagiarism range from failure for a paper or course to dismissal from the University.
